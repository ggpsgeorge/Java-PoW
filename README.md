## Objective

Just a simple implementation of the PoW algorithm in Java. I don't recommend the use of Java for this kind of problem. It's just a fun project.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependencies

None. For now.
